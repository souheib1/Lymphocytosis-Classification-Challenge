# DLMI - Lymphocytosis classification
Classification of lymphocytosis from white blood cells.

**Team name:** SB-MC
## Project Description
This project was realized in the Deep Learning for Medical Imaging course. The primary goal was to leverage machine learning techniques to predict whether a patientâ€™s lymphocytes are reactive or tumoral. The challenge involved a provided dataset containing patient information, blood smear images, and clinical attributes. This repository contains our solution to the method which yielded a Balanced Accuracy Score equal to 0.823.

## How to use our code 

We have structured this repository to contain the main components of our architecture in the `.py` files, while the notebook folder houses different experiments conducted during the project.

To reproduce our results, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/souheib1/Lymphocytosis-Classification-Challenge.git
   ```

2- Download the dataset (using the instructions in the dataset folder) 

3- Install the requirements    
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4 - Run the notebooks
